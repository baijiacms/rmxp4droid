 * <h3>4.4.Involved people list</h3>
 * <p/>
 * <p class=t> Since there might be a lot of people contributing to an audio file in various ways, such as musicians and
 * technicians, the 'Text information frames' are often insufficient to list everyone involved in a project. The
 * 'Involved people list' is a frame containing the names of those involved, and how they were involved. The body simply
 * contains a terminated string with the involvement directly followed by a terminated string with the involvee followed
 * by a new involvement and so on. There may only be one "IPLS" frame in each tag. </p>

 * encoding</td><td>$xx</td></tr> <tr><td>People list strings</td><td>&lt;text strings according to
